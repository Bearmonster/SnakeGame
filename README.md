# SnakeGame
I made a simple snake game. It is basic but it works fine.
Circle.h Create a circle object and reset x and y to given values or to default which is 0. I will use this class for snake body which will be defined as a list of type Circle
and for fod.
In Imput.h is created a new instance of Hashtable class.
In Setting.h I have a enum class to classify directions for game. Also set game parameters to default values.
In Myform.h are function that has to get input key from player, move player, updateGraphics and eat function.
